I found this to be a fascinating project and seeing by the end what machine elarning algorithms are capable of demonstrated to me why I have such a passion for data analytics and data science. 

This project explores ways in which medical data from cardiotocograms can be utilized to predict fetal health into one of three categories. Since this test is minimally invasive and cost effective, a robust ML model could result in improved health and cost efficiencies.

I dive further into the details within the notebook itself, but a 95% accuracy, precision, and recall were obtained. 

The raw data can be found in the fetal_health.csv file and I have included my jupyter notebook for this project.

I hope you enjoy it!
